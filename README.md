# molecularmodels-3d-printing-profiles
A repository created for storage and distribution of PrusaSlicer and BambuStudio 3D printing profiles used for the fabrication of molecular models generated with [3DP-Jmol](https://github.com/mariusmihasan/3DP-Jmol) or with the Print3D tool in [Proteopedia](https://proteopedia.org/wiki/index.php/Main_Page).

-------------------------------------------
Profiles were developed and validated with support from EDUMOL3D, Project [PN-IV-P7-7.1-PED-2024-0343](http://cercetare.bio.uaic.ro/grupuri/bioactive/content/grants/PED2024_mm.html) financed by the Ministry of Research, Innovation and Digitization, [UEFISCDI](https://uefiscdi.gov.ro/), Romania.
